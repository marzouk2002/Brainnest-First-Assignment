                <h4>Nico Robin</h4>
                <p>Nico Robin, also known by her epithet "<em>Devil Child</em>" and the "<em>Light of the Revolution</em>", is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates. She is the seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during the Water 7 Arc, but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc.</p>
                <p>Nico Robin is a tall and slender young woman with shoulder-length black hair, and eyes that have dark, wide pupils (her eyes are depicted to be brown in manga as well as the tenth and twelfth movies; while in the anime, her eyes are depicted to be blue). She also has a long, thin and defined nose. In the anime, Robin's skin tone is slightly darker tan unlike in manga colored artworks where it is lighter. Robin also resembles her mother greatly, with the exception of her hair color and style as well as having slightly darker skin tone than her. Robin's limbs are very long, especially her legs, contributing greatly to both her fighting capabilities (given the nature of her powers) and overall height.</p>
